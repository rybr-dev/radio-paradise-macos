# Contributing to Radio Paradise for macOS

First off — thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is built and maintained by the community, and your help makes it better for everyone.

## 📬 Filing Issues

Issues are a great way to report bugs, request features, or ask questions.  
Before you open a new issue:

1. **Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rybr-dev/radio-paradise-macos/issues)** to see if your idea or problem has already been reported.
2. If you find an existing issue that matches, add your details as a comment or use a 👍 reaction instead of opening a new one.
3. If it’s a bug report, please include:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - macOS version and app version
   - Any relevant screenshots or logs

Clear, detailed reports make it much easier to fix things quickly.

## 🛠 Contributing Code

If you’d like to submit code:

1. First ask yourself: **does this benefit the Radio Paradise community?**
2. **Open an issue first** to discuss your idea, unless it’s a small typo/bug fix.  
   This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures the change aligns with the project’s goals.
3. Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main` for your changes.
4. Make sure your code:
   - Is clear and easy to follow
   - Avoids unnecessary dependencies
   - Passes any existing build/lint steps
5. Test your changes on a recent version of macOS before submitting.

When ready, open a Pull Request (PR) and:
- Reference the related issue(s)
- Explain the “why” behind your changes, not just the “what”
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible

## 💡 Good Practices

- Be respectful and constructive — this is a welcoming space.
- Prefer smaller, incremental changes over big, sweeping ones.
- Keep commit messages clear and descriptive.
- Review others’ PRs if you have time — feedback is always appreciated.
- Remember: it’s okay to ask for help or clarification.
